## Usage & Docs

This is on the way ...

Include an example of how to include a library in `codal.json`

See a simple example of usage in my repo [here](https://github.com/olihulland/microbit-clap-seq-tflite). And a wider discussion of my experiences of ML on micro:bit [here](https://gist.github.com/olihulland/6ed197a490ee012c5d072556ddc76476).

**For a fun, more complete example of using ML on microbit using this extension, look at my Cloudlet AI work [here](https://github.com/olihulland/Cloudlet-AI).**
